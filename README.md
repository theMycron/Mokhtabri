# Setting up the Project
The project was designed to run on iPhone 14 Pro and iPad Pro 12.9-inch.

Sample data will be loaded if no AppData was found. The sample data includes a number of patients, bookings, hospitals, and labs, with tests for all facilities and some packages. The sample packages have some inaccurate data (the tests listed in the image are different from the tests stored for the package) because of time constraints, but the sample data as a whole should resemble real-world usage of the app.
